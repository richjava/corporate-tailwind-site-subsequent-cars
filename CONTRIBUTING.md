When adding a new feature to this project:
1. Create an issue on the repo for the feature with the following naming convention: feature_[feature name]_[sub-feature name], i.e. "feature_contact" or "feature_contact_meet-the-team
2. Create a branch from the issue
3. Checkout the newly created branch
4. Try to keep the new feature as encapsulated as possible
5. When the feature is ready for the next release, commit and push
6. Create a merge request to merge the feature branch with the "dev" branch (not "master")
